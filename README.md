# Color-Generator
I made a simple color code generator using Hex Codes via HTML, CSS and Javascript.
<!-- Special Note -->
I realized that putting Javascript into HTML (INTERNAL WRITING) is not only confusing, but it's considered bad practice. 
At this point, I am learning to write in Javascript Vanilla, so as the time comes and I put more into practice, I will put my Javascript
into its own separate file via linking it externally.
